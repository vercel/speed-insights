## Quickstart

1. Enable Vercel Speed Insights for a project in the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fspeed-insights&title=Open+Web+Analytics).
2. Add the `@vercel/speed-insights` package to your project
3. Inject Speed Insights to your app

   - If you are using **Next.js**, **React**, **Remix**, **React Router**, **Nuxt** or **Vue** you can use the framework-specific `<SpeedInsights />` component to inject the script into your app.
   - If you are using **Sveltekit**, you can use the `injectSpeedInsights()` function `@vercel/speed-insights/sveltekit` in your top-level `+layout.js/ts` file.
   - For other frameworks, you can use the `inject` function add the tracking script to your app.
   - If you want to use Vercel Speed Insights on a static site without npm, follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/quickstart).

4. Deploy your app to Vercel and see data flowing in.
